Lost Keys United
================
Lost Keys United is a AI that can play Cloud Ball. It's a fresh start after
creating "De Wolkenhondjes" for the original challenge of Giraff.

Version 4.0
-----------
Elementary (pre-computed) passing added. The field is split into zones, how to
get there, and which zones, should not be occupied by any opponent.

Version 3.1 (Elo 1650)
----------------------
Changed to two scenarios: Possession and default. Implemented a very basic
way of passing, and one player that tries to get close to the goal.

Version 2.0 (Elo 1600)
----------------------
Introduced roles (like keeper) on top of scenario's (on the ball, pick up the
ball, ect.). Implemented only the keeper role for now.

Version 1.0 (Elo 1450)
----------------------
Calculate the path of the ball, and sends only the player that can catch up
with it first. If on the ball, shoot on goal.

Elos
----
Based on a test set where "De Wolkenhondjes 3" was set as the reference engine with an
Elo of 1600.
